Gathers posts with certain #hashtags from various social media sources.

== Description ==

**Social Mentions** gathers posts with certain #hashtags from various social media sources every 30 minutes using wp_cron.

It comes with predefined CSS classes for the output list but nothing is styled so you can fit it to your theme as needed.

The setup is really easy. Simply follow the instructions in the Settings area of the plugin to create your API Keys for each supported social media and input the #hashtags that you want to fetch to your page and use the shortcode `[social-mentions show="#something"]` on the page you want to view the list.

This plugin is based on the idea of the [Tagregator](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tagregator) plugin, greetings & props to all the people who have been contributing to it all this time.
